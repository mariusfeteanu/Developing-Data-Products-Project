## Shiny Regression Model Builder

This simple shiny app can be used to see what factors might impact vehicle performance.

## Can be used to fit one of three dependent variables

- Miles/(US) gallon
- Gross horsepower
- 1/4 mile time

## This is done using the mtcars data set as input. Any independent variables can be chosen as input.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)
setdiff(colnames(mtcars), c("mpg", "hp", "qsec"))
```

## Press the submit button after selecting parameters to see a table with factors and pretty graphs.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(lm(hp~., mtcars))
```
